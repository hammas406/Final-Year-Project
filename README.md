# Automated System for Issuance and Dispatch of Educational Documents

This project was developed as my Final Year Project (FYP) for the Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at BUITEMS (Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences). The system automates the manual process of issuing and dispatching educational documents such as transcripts and degrees, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To digitize and streamline the issuance process for educational documents.
- To minimize human errors in data entry and verification.
- To provide real-time tracking of document status and dispatch.
- To enhance institutional efficiency and record management.

## ⚙️ Features
- Secure login system with role-based access (Admin, Staff, Student).
- Automated document generation with pre-verified student data.
- Status tracking for issuance and dispatch of documents.
- Database management for student records.
- Notification system for document readiness or dispatch.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** PHP (or Python / your chosen language)  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Tools & Environment:** XAMPP, Visual Studio Code, GitHub  

## 🧪 Implementation
The project follows standard Software Engineering methodologies, including requirement analysis, system design, development, testing, and deployment.  
The system can be integrated with university management portals for better scalability and automation.

## 📄 Results
The implemented system successfully automated key processes, significantly reducing document issuance and dispatch time while maintaining accuracy and data integrity.
